Summary
QA Engineer with 6 years experience.

Professional Interests
Now I'm trying different languages to choose the main one.
I'd passed Python courses and develop my pet project on Django. Sometimes writing autotests on Pytest.
Also, I tried Swift and still fighting with CorData integration in my simple app.
But the most I like is JavaScript because it's really universal, interactive and it's used everywhere.

About me
I like to play the guitar and make electronic music.
